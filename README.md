# Spam-Email-Classification-Model

## Overview
This repository contains a Spam Email Classification Model implemented using Logistic Regression. The model is trained on a labeled dataset of emails to distinguish between spam and non-spam (ham) emails. The primary goal of this project is to build an efficient and accurate classifier to automatically detect spam emails.

## Dataset
The dataset used for training and evaluating the model is sourced from Kaggle's Spam Email Classification dataset. The dataset contains two main columns: "Text" (email content) and "Label" (spam or ham).

## Model Architecture
The Spam Email Classification Model is implemented using Logistic Regression, a simple yet effective classification algorithm. It learns to classify emails based on their content features and assigns probabilities for each class (spam or ham). The threshold probability is set to 0.5 for classification.

## Libraries used
1.Numpy
2.Pandas
3.Scikit-learn

## Download the Kaggle dataset:
Go to the Kaggle dataset page: Spam Email Classification.
Download the dataset as mail_data.csv.
Place the mail_data.csv file in the data/ directory.

## Performance
The model's performance is evaluated using various metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score on the test set. The results show that the model achieves an accuracy of 92% in classifying spam emails.
